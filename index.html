        <div>
            <h3>Step-1: Search " git scm " in google.</h3>
            <p>Note: here "scm" means "Source Code Management". In the "git scm" website you have to download a software (git) which will help you to connect github to your local computer's "code"</p>

            <h3>Step-2: Enter in the "Git SCM" website.</h3>

            <h3>Step-3: Find the "download for windows" button and click the button for starting the download.</h3>

            <h3>Step-4: Open the downloaded file > click "next", "next", "next" .... and click "install" > then uncheck or check the items in the last page, its your wish ( I prefer uncheck the items ) and click "next".</h3>
            <p>Note: For checking git software has been installed or not: open command prompt (write cmd in your windows search bar) > write "git" > without the double qoute write " git --version " > press "enter" > then it will show you the git version number ( if it did not install properly, you will not see the version number. In this situtation you have to delete the software and try to reinstall the software following those steps ).</p>

            <h3>Step-5: Search " github " in google.</h3>

            <h3>Step-6: Enter in the " GitHub " website.</h3>

            <h3>Step-7: " Sign up " for github by giving a unique username, an email and password.</h3>

            <h3>Step-8: verify your account by clicking the " verify " button > then do what they tell you to do.</h3>

            <h3>Step-9: then click on " next: select a plan " button.</h3>

            <h3>Step-10: Choose a plan which suite you the most ( I prefer the " free plan " ).</h3>

            <h3>step-11: If they tell you to do something more, you can do that or just find the " skip " button and click on it ( I prefer skipping ).</h3>

            <h3>step-12: Verify your email address by going to your gmail account. They have send you an email. Open the email and click the "verify" button inside the email.</h3>

            <h3>step-13: Find " create repository " button and click on it for creating a repository.</h3>
            <p>Note: people call "repository" "repo" in short. Repository like a local computer's specific folder or directory.</p>

            <h3>step-14: Give a "repository name" (I prefer to give the same name like my local computer code folder) > click on public if want to show this repo to others or choose private ( I prefer public ). > Then click on " Create Repository " button.</h3>

        <h1>Hi, I am a Github Practice. This is my first pushed and I have been pushed by running this command: 
            ( 1. git init |2. git add . |3. git commit -m "My first ever commit" 
            |4. git remote add origin https://github.com/aowladmuhammad/portfoliodemo.git
            |5. git push -u origin master)
        </h1>
        
        <h3>I have been changed once and I have been pushed by runing this commands:
            ( 1. git add . |2. git commit -m "Learned version control" |3. git push )
        </h3>
        
        <h3>I have been changed twice and I have been pulled by running this command:
            ( git pull )
        </h3>

        <h3>I have been changed thrice. I have created a branch in github server and in local server.
            I have changed my branch origin to "develop" by running this command: 
            ( 1.git branch develop |2. git checkout develop )
        </h3>

        <p>One single command for creating and replacing a branch "features":
            (git checkout -b features)
            For pushing it just replace origin. such as: git push -u origin features
            or git push --set-upstream origin features
        </p>
        bad idea
